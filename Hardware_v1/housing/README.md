# KUKSA.hardware housing

This contains 3d-printable STL files for a housing. 

[housing-top.stl](./housing-top.stl) and [housing-bottom.stl](./housing-bottom.stl) give you the main case (with some handy cutouts from HDMI and the OTG USB port for debugging), while [antenna-bracket-basic.stl](./antenna-bracket-basic.stl) and [antenna-bracket-lock.stl](./antenna-bracket-lock.stl) give support for an LTE antenna and active GPS antenna.

To see how this looks assembled, check the [KUKSA_PiOBD_V0.3.pdf](./KUKSA_PiOBD_V0.3.pdf) file. Please note, the PDF contains a 3D model of the dongle itself inside the housing. This type of content is not supported by many PDF viewers. Therefore, we recommend using the original [Adobe Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/) to view it.
